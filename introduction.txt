#Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Muhammed Seid Ebrahim, a passionate and determined young individual from Ethiopia. I recently completed my secondary education at Kingâ€™s Academy, following the Natural Science stream. With a strong academic background in subjects like Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, I have developed a keen interest in technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence and its applications in real-world problem-solving. I am also certified in programming from Udacity and have gained foundational skills in web development through SoloLearn.

Beyond academics, I actively participated in a city-wide Science and Technology competition and engaged in extracurricular activities like the Girl Club, promoting equality and leadership. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in AI automation and working on building a personalized e-commerce recommendation business with my brother. I believe in using innovation to create positive change and aspire to grow into a leading expert in AI and digital strategy.
